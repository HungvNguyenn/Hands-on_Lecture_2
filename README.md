Pascal_Triangle.java: 
A program that implement Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle each number is the sum of the two numbers
that are above
for example if there is 5 rows it would be:
                    1
                   1 1
                  1 2 1
                 1 3 3 1
                1 4 6 4 1
The implementation uses properties of binomial coefficient to compute each number in each row using C(i,j). 

Spiral_matrix.java:
This is a program that return a spiral order of a given 2D array. 
for example:
input: matrix = [[1,2,3]
                 [4,5,6]
                 [7,8,9]]

output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
